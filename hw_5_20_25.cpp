/*
 * TODO: What's Happening
 * I want you to research std::list or C++ standard library's linked list implementaiton.
 * The problem to sove:
 * you have intergers stored in vector<uint16_t> data
 * I need you to put all of it into a linked list (std::list) as "first_version"
 * Then, create a copy of this list in "second_version" 
 * Without using std::list::reverse() or the list reverse function, reverse all values of second_version
 * Finally, check that you did the reverse properly by using std::list::reverse() on first_version
 * Verify.
 *
 * command to compile and run:
 * gcc <name of file here> -Wall -Werror -o <name of program> && ./<name of program>
 * && makes it so it will run the first command (gcc) before ./ or the run command
 *
 * All you should need to know is in cppreference; you can also search std::list
 *
 *
